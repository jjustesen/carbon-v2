# VSCode Import/Export Analyzer

## Overview

The VSCode Import/Export Analyzer is a powerful extension for Visual Studio Code that helps developers understand and visualize the structure of their JavaScript and TypeScript projects. By analyzing import and export statements, this tool provides valuable insights into module dependencies and code organization.

## Features

- **Import/Export Analysis**: Quickly identify where files are imported and exported within your project.
- **Export Breakdown**: Analyze exports in detail, including individual functions and default exports.
- **Import Tracking**: Locate where each export is being used throughout your codebase.
- **Visual Dependency Graph**: Generate an interactive graphical representation of your project's import/export structure.
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically update analysis as you modify your code.

<!-- ## Installation

1. Download the `.vsix` file from the latest release.
2. Open VSCode and navigate to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).

2. Use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for:
   - "Analyze Imports and Exports" to run the analysis
   - "Show Import/Export Graph" to visualize the dependency structure
3. The Import/Export Explorer view will display detailed information about the current file's imports and exports.

## Benefits

- **Improved Code Navigation**: Quickly understand how modules are connected.
- **Refactoring Assistance**: Easily identify the impact of moving or renaming modules.
- **Dependency Management**: Visualize and manage complex dependency structures.
- **Code Review Aid**: Simplify the process of reviewing import/export patterns in pull requests.
